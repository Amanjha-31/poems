 	<pre>
     The rain is raining all around,
     It falls on field and tree,
     It rains on the umbrellas here,
     And on the ships at sea.

    <h2 style="background-color: powderblue;text-decoration-style:wavy; text-decoration:overline;  font-style: oblique; text-align: center;">TREe
    </h2>
 	<pre>
I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.

A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the sweet earthâ€™s flowing breast;

A tree that looks at God all day,
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;

A tree that may in summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;

Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.

Poems are made by fools like me,
But only God can make a tree.
